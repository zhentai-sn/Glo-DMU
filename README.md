# Glo-DMU
glomerulus ultrastructural characterization by deep learning

---
We develop the glomerular morphometry framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular filtration barrier classification model, and the electron-dense deposits detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis, this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane (GBM), the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and the location of electron-dense deposits (EDD).

The code will be released according to the work plan.
